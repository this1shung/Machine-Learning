# Bulldozer-SellPrice-Prediction

This project originated from a Kaggle competition ten years ago with the goal of predicting the sale prices of bulldozers based on historical bulldozer sale prices from previous years.

I will summarize information about this project below:
# Problem definition
 - This time, we will be predicting the sale price of bulldozers, which is a value that can go up or down. Therefore, this project will revolve around a regression problem, where we aim to predict a continuous numerical value (the sale price) based on various features and historical data.
# Data
 - The data for this project is provided by Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data
 - The dataset is divided into three parts:

   + Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
      
   + Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.
       
   + Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.
 - In addition to being a regression problem, this project primarily focuses on the data preprocessing aspect i have performed several data preprocessing steps(across the train,valid and test data) to create a suitable dataset:

   + When initially working with the dataset, I observed that the date values are stored as an 'object' data type instead of the 'datetime' data type. Therefore, I had to change it.
       
   + A significant portion of the data was also missing
       
   + I also encountered a significant amount of non-numeric data (data that needed to be transformed for machine learning models to understand). During this process, I converted object data types into numerical types, and I also handled missing data.
# Features
 - There are many attributes in the dataset, and I will list 10 of them here. In the notebook , I also performed a step to find feature importance to determine which attributes have the most significant impact on the model's predictions. Here are 10 attributes from the dataset:

   1.SalesID: Unique identifier of a particular sale of a machine at auction

   2.MachineID: Identifier for a particular machine; machines may have multiple sales

   3.ModelID: Identifier for a unique machine model (i.e. fiModelDesc)

   4.Datasource: Source of the sale record; some sources are more diligent about reporting attributes of the machine than others. Note that a particular datasource may report on multiple auctioneerIDs.

   5.auctioneerID: Identifier of a particular auctioneer, i.e. company that sold the machine at auction. Not the same as datasource.

   6.YearMade: Year of manufacturer of the Machine

   7.MachineHoursCurrentMeter: Current usage of the machine in hours at time of sale (saledate); null or 0 means no hours have been reported for that sale

   8.UsageBand: Value (low, medium, high) calculated comparing this particular Machine-Sale hours to average usage for the fiBaseModel; e.g. 'Low' means this machine has less hours given it's lifespan 
   relative to average of fiBaseModel.

   9.Saledate: Time of sale

   10.Saleprice: Cost of sale in USD(only appear in train set and valid set)
# Evaluation metrics
 - The evaluation metric specified by Kaggle for the project is Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE). In addition to that, i have also used the R-squared (R2) metric and some other evaluation metric.
# Model 
 - After trying various regression model, I didn't find any other model as effective as the RandomForestRegressor. Therefore, I decided to focus on using and improving it.
# Wrapping Up 
 - Above is the summary of the project I have provided, and all the code and workflow are documented in the notebook.
 - Here is some picture of my work:
