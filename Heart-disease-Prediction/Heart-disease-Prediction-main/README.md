# Heart-disease-Prediction

Here's a brief summary of this project:

- This is my first personal project that I've undertaken as I begin learning about data science and machine learning. It's a binary classification problem, meaning there are only two possible outcomes in the context of this dataset: whether a patient has a heart disease (1) or not (0).

- The tools I used in this project include Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and the model evaluation metrics I focused on the is accuracy.
